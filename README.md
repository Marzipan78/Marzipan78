### Hello there! My name is Paramveer Singh - aka Marzipan78 👋


## Data Scientist || Data Analyst || Data for Growth!!

- There is a lot of talk about how we have only collected about 3% of the data available. When you look at what has already been achieved and what is in the pipeline
it makes you wonder about all the possibilities that can take place when we can leverage the data.
- I enjoy studying the underlying and hidden patterns and trends in the data in order to make meaningful and impactful solutions for the people.
- My main aim is to leave a mark with a product that will shape the way forward and be sustainable 🌱.
- I enjoy working on projects in the realm of NLP and ComputerVision. This bag of words can be visualized 😝.

- Constantly learning, trying to get MLOps under the belt whilst working and helping other people realize their potential to work with data
- Love to learn new languages, currently improving my Deutsch and Hrvatski.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other curious bugs just like me, no matter what the topic is, well preferably in the field of AI 😝
- Completed my Master's in Finance and wrote a thesis on Portfolio Optimization using LSTM networks to build optimal portfolios and also studied the performance during the pandemic, the capability to outperform the benchmark portfolio during that time too.
- 🥅 Former International Cricket player for Kenya, still enjoy playing the sport and love to watch Football and F1 and discuss all the strategies and numbers involved. Love to cook and eat xD
